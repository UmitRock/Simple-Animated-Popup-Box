            <h2>Umit Rock</h2>
            <P>
                But I must explain to you how all
                this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
                and praising pain was born and I will 
                give you a complete account of the system,
                and expound the actual teachings of
                the great explorer of the truth, the 
                master-builder of human happiness. No one 
                rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
                because it is pleasure, but because those 
                who do not know how to pursue pleasure 
                rationally encounter consequences that are 
                extremely painful.
            </P>
